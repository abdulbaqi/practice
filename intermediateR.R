# these practics are from DataCamp intermediate course
# on R

"hello" > "Goodbye"
# the above is true because R does comparision alphabatically

# Comparison of logicals
T == F

# Comparison of numerics
(-6 * 14) != (17- 101)

# Comparison of character strings
"useR" == "user"

# Compare a logical with a numeric
T == 1
